# Clothes-Pridiction-Using-CNN

### Introduction
This project detects the type of apperal (clothes or shoes) shown in the image. This is done using Deep Convoluted Neural Network. This project is trained using fashin_mnist dataset. The training dataset consists around 60000 grayscale images and the test dataset consists around 10000 grayscale images. There are in all 10 categories i.e. 
1. T-Shirt/Top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal 
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
10. Ankle Boot

### Dependencies
- Python3
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

###Basic Usage
The repository makes use of the Keras API using the tensorflow.keras library.

1. First clone the repository git clone https://github.com/sahil0220/Clothes-Pridiction-Using-CNN
2. No need To download any datasets.
3. If you want to train this model, use: cd Clothes_Prediction.ipynb 
4. If you want to view the predictions without training again, you can download the pre-trained model from here and then run: cd clothing_classification_model.h5
